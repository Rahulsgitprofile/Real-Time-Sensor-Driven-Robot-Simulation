Project | Robotic Sensor Systems |
Technologies: Unity 2022.3, ESP8266 (Arduino C++), MQTT (Mosquitto), C#

This project demonstrates ** real-time integration of embedded sensor systems** with a 3D game environment using Unity. The goal was to simulate a responsive robotic system where physical sensor data from an **ESP8266 microcontroller** drives actions in a virtual world.
