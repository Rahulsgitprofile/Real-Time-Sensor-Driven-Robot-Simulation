## ðŸ”§ Features

### Embedded System (ESP8266 with Arduino IDE)
- Acquired real-time data from:
  - **MPU6050**: Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Temperature sensor
  - **Capacitive sensor**: Touch detection
  - **Rotary Encoder**: Directional input
  - **Infrared Sensor**: Proximity detection
- Implemented signal filtering (e.g., moving average, threshold filters)
- Established **Wi-Fi communication** using **MQTT protocol (Mosquitto broker)**
